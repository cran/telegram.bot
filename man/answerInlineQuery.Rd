\title{Send answers to an inline query}
\usage{
answerInlineQuery(inline_query_id, results, cache_time = 300L,
  is_personal = NULL, next_offset = NULL, switch_pm_text = NULL,
  switch_pm_parameter = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{inline_query_id}{Unique identifier for the answered query.}

\item{results}{A list of \code{\link{InlineQueryResult}} for the inline
query.}

\item{cache_time}{(Optional). The maximum amount of time in seconds that the
result of the inline query may be cached on the server.}

\item{is_personal}{(Optional). Pass \code{TRUE}, if results may be cached on
the server side only for the user that sent the query. By default,
results may be returned to any user who sends the same query.}

\item{next_offset}{(Optional). Pass the offset that a client should send in
the next query with the same text to receive more results. Pass an empty
string if there are no more results or if you don't support pagination.
Offset length can't exceed 64 bytes.}

\item{switch_pm_text}{(Optional). If passed, clients will display a button
with specified text that switches the user to a private chat with the
bot and sends the bot a start message with the parameter
\code{switch_pm_parameter}.}

\item{switch_pm_parameter}{(Optional). Deep-linking parameter for the
    \code{/start} message sent to the bot when user presses the switch
    button. 1-64 characters, only \code{A-Z}, \code{a-z}, \code{0-9},
    \code{_} and \code{-} are allowed.

    \emph{Example:} An inline bot that sends YouTube videos can ask the user
    to connect the bot to their YouTube account to adapt search results
    accordingly. To do this, it displays a 'Connect your YouTube account'
    button above the results, or even before showing any. The user presses
    the button, switches to a private chat with the bot and, in doing so,
    passes a start parameter that instructs the bot to return an auth link.
    Once done, the bot can offer a switch_inline button so that the user can
    easily return to the chat where they wanted to use the bot's inline
    capabilities.}

\description{

\details{
To enable this option, send the \code{/setinline} command to
\href{https://t.me/botfather}{@BotFather} and provide the placeholder text
